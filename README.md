🪙 DevToken – ERC-20 Token Project
This project is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token named DevToken.
The goal was to learn how to create and deploy a new token to the blockchain, and to interact with it via balanceOf and transfer functions.

The smart contract has been deployed on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, and tested using Remix IDE, MetaMask, and Polygonscan.

📌 What this repo contains
devtoken.sol → The smart contract code written in Solidity.
proof-of-work/ → Screenshots proving that the contract was successfully deployed and tested.
This README.md → With all the information about the project.
✅ What was tested
balanceOf → Check the token balance of an address.
transfer → Send tokens from one address to another.

🚀 Goal of the project
This project is the first step toward building decentralized applications.
By creating and deploying a custom token, it demonstrates the developer’s ability to bring new assets to the blockchain, and interact with them through smart contract functions.
