# 🪙 DevToken – ERC-20 Token Project

This project is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token named **DevToken**.  
The goal was to learn how to **create and deploy a new token** to the blockchain, and to interact with it via `balanceOf` and `transfer` functions.

The smart contract has been deployed on the **Polygon Amoy Testnet**, and tested using **Remix IDE**, **MetaMask**, and **Polygonscan**.

## 📌 What this repo contains

- `devtoken.sol` → The smart contract code written in Solidity.
- `proof-of-work/` → Screenshots proving that the contract was successfully deployed and tested.
- This `README.md` → With all the information about the project.

---

## ✅ What was tested

- `balanceOf` → Check the token balance of an address.
- `transfer` → Send tokens from one address to another.

---

## 🔗 Smart Contract Info

- **Deployed to Polygon Amoy**
- [View on Polygonscan](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x84855c946b3493fAae038E0855B023Ad1613D088)

## 📷 Proof of Work

Screenshots inside the `proof-of-work/` folder show:

1. Deployment confirmation on Remix  
2. Token balance checked with `balanceOf`  
3. Transfer done with `transfer`  
4. Transactions verified on Polygonscan

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Solidity + Remix IDE
- MetaMask (Polygon Amoy testnet)
- Polygonscan

## 🚀 Goal of the project

This project is the first step toward building decentralized applications.  
By creating and deploying a custom token, it demonstrates the developer’s ability to **bring new assets to the blockchain**, and **interact with them through smart contract functions**.
